# FISI4997: Basics of ML Final Project

This notebook holds the material for two projects. You may choose the one you wish to work on. The two projects are:

* Higgs Classification Project
* Electron/Photon Classification Project

As their title suggests, these are both classification problems. You job will be to build a machine learning model able to distinguish between background and Higgs events in the **Higgs Boson Classification Project**, or between photons and electrons in the **Electron/Photon Classification Project**.

## Running Notebooks

To begin running the notebooks, click on one of the following buttons to open the notebook of your choice in Google Colab. Afterwards, you should save the notebook to your Google Drive in order to save your progress.

* Higgs Boson Classification Challenge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roy-cruz/FISI4997-MLBasicsProj/blob/main/HiggsClassification/higgs_classification.ipynb)
* Particle Images Challenge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roy-cruz/FISI4997-MLBasicsProj/blob/main/EGammaClassification/egamma_classification.ipynb)

## Submission 

The deliverables of your project will be:

* `.ipynb` (and a PDF version of it with outputs showing your results) file showing your solution, including your study of the data, final model structure, hyperparameters and the wat the model was trained that yielded the best possible performance.
* Final model accuracy (training and validation) ROC curve and AUC score, as well as an additional plot (e.g. precision-recall curves, confusion matrix) which further showcases the performance of your model.
* Your trained model containing the model architecture and its trained weights (HDF5 file, .pb file, .pt file, etc.). Also show in your notebooks how to load and use your model.

In short, the notebook you submit will serve as the report of your work as well as the place where your code will live and be executed in.

**Note: You are free to use the ML framework of your choice.**

**DEADLINE: November 30th**
