# FISI4997: Basics of ML Final Project

This notebook holds the material for two projects. You may choose the one you wish to work on. The two projects are:

* Higgs Boson Classification Challenge
* Particle Images Challenge

As their title suggests, these are both classification problems. You job will be to build a machine learning model able to distinguish between background and Higgs events in the **Higgs Boson Classification Challenge**, or between photons and electrons in the **Particle Images Challenge**.

## Running Notebooks

To begin running the notebooks, click on one of the following buttons to open the notebook of your choice in Google Colab. Afterwards, you should save the notebook to your Google Drive in order to save your progress.

* Higgs Boson Classification Challenge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roy-cruz/FISI4997-MLBasicsProj/blob/main/HiggsBosonClassificationChallenge/higgs_classification.ipynb)
* Particle Images Challenge: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roy-cruz/FISI4997-MLBasicsProj/blob/main/ParticleImagesChallenge/ParticleImages.ipynb)

## Submission 

The deliverables of your project will be:

* `.ipynb` file showing your solution and the final model structure, parameters and hyper-parameters yielding the best possible performance.
* Final model accuracy (training and validation) ROC curve and AUC score, as well as an additional plot (e.g. precision-recall curves, confusion matrix) which further showcases the performance of your model 
* Your trained model containing the model architecture and its trained weights (HDF5 file, .pb file, .pt file, etc). Also show in your notebooks how to load and use your model.

**Note: You are free to use the ML framework of your choice.**

**DEADLINE: November 30th**
